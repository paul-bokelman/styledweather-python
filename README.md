# Project Plan: 
## "Stylized Weather" 
 - An interactive weather site with dynamic weather system to show real time data of climate, temperature, time, weather, and more.
 - Custom designs will be assigned to each type of weather, making a more fluid and connected theme on the website
 - Users will be able to input "opinions" about the weather when logged in
 - Looking to use 3 databases for login/signup, API, and opinions list
